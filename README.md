# Booney-Skript-Testing
Many of my Misc. Skript Projects will be here if I choose to make them public

# Requirements to use the code:
- You will likely need a paper server, or atleast a way to host one.
As long as you have a way to have plugins, it works fine I suppose.

If any files need updating, PLEASE contact me on Discord, my username is @booney.edit

- You will need the following Skript Plugins (will be updated if needed):
1. Skript
2. Skbee
3. PoaSK
4. skript-reflect
